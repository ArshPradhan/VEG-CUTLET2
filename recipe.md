1. Boil 1 large potato, 1 medium carrot and ½ cup green peas very well in a steamer or pressure cooker. You can also add 6 to 8 french beans.
2. When the veggies are cooling, blitz 5 to 6 slices of bread in a food processor or grinder till fine to get bread crumbs. You can use any bread – white bread, brown bread or whole wheat bread.
3. Keep the bread crumbs aside in a plate or tray.
4. Peel the potatoes and carrots and chop them. Take them in a bowl along with the cooked peas. Make sure the veggies are drained well before you peel and chop them.
5. Mash them with a masher or fork. Don’t make a smooth and pasty mixture. It should be a slightly chunky mixture.
6. Add 1.5 tsp crushed ginger+garlic+green chili paste (2-3 small garlic cloves + ½ inch ginger + 1-2 green chilies crushed to a paste in mortar-pestle), ¼ tsp red chili powder, ½ tsp cumin powder, ½ tsp garam masala powder, 3 tbsp bread crumbs and salt as required. Skip garlic if you don’t use it. If the mixture feels moist and sticky, then add 1 tbsp more of the bread crumbs.
7. Instead of bread crumbs you can also add 2 to 3 slices of bread dipped in water and then squeezed completely of the water.
8. Mix everything very well. Check the taste and add more salt or the spice powders if required.
9. In another small bowl, take 2 tbsp maida (all purpose flour) and 3 tbsp water. For a healthier option instead of all purpose flour, you can use gram flour (besan) or maize flour (corn meal or makki ka atta). Add water as required then to make a thick flowing paste.
10. Stir and mix this mixture to get a smooth paste without any lumps. This step of making the all purpose flour paste is optional and you can skip it. Generally cutlet is dipped in beaten eggs. Here, all purpose flour paste substitutes the beaten eggs.
11. Now take the cutlet mixture in a plate and using a cutlet mould, shape it or make small to medium-sized round cutlet by rolling and flattening the portions of the mixture in your palms.
12. Prepare or shape the entire mixture into a round cutlet or shaped cutlet.
13. Heat 2 to 3 tbsp oil for shallow frying in a pan. Take a cutlet and dip in the maida paste gently.
14. Coat the paste evenly all over the cutlet.
15. Then coat the cutlet in breadcrumbs. If you do not have breadcrumbs, then you can also use rava (sooji or cream of wheat). Coat the veg cutlet with rava.
16. Coat the cutlet evenly with the breadcrumbs.
17. Dust the excess bread crumbs and place the cutlet in the medium hot oil.
18. Dip each vegetable cutlet this way in all-purpose flour paste, coat with bread crumbs and keep on the pan for frying.
19. When one side is golden, flip and fry the other side. Add more oil if required.
20. Flip a couple of times more and fry all the patties till they are evenly golden and crisp from all sides.
21. Drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.
22. Serve veg cutlet hot with mint chutney or coriander chutney or tamarind chutney.
